# Spotify-Album-Finder

If you've scrolled through social media, perhaps you've seen a "receipt" of your friends' top songs from a website called Receiptify. Michelle Liu, the creator of the website, used the Spotify API to curate your monthly “receipt” of top songs. The site became so popular, acquiring over a million users per month.
To help us create our Album Finder, we'll be using some JavaScript-centric tools in our application.
React is a JavaScript library for building UIs (user interfaces). With reusable components, React makes it easier for us to create web applications! Components can be buttons, widgets, cards, and more, as you create them.

To access the API, head over to the Spotify for Developers website and log in with your Spotify account. If you don't have one, you can create one through the Spotify website.

Once you're on the Dashboard, click "Create App".

Here, you're going to give your app a name! Try "Album Finder" or "Spotify Music Finder"!

Give your app a description and a redirect URI. Since we're creating an app for our personal use, insert the redirect as http://localhost/.
